# Unified Agent - Calendar & Gmail Assistant

## üîç Advanced Usage

### Gmail Search Syntax

The unified agent supports Gmail's powerful search syntax:

- `from:john@example.com` - Emails from specific sender
- `to:alice@company.com` - Emails sent to specific recipient
- `subject:meeting` - Emails with "meeting" in subject
- `is:unread` - Unread emails
- `is:read` - Read emails
- `has:attachment` - Emails with attachments
- `label:important` - Emails with specific label
- `after:2024/01/01` - Emails after specific date
- `before:2024/12/31` - Emails before specific date

### Date and Time Formats

- **Dates**: Use `YYYY-MM-DD` format or natural language like "tomorrow", "next Friday"
- **Times**: Use `HH:MM` format or natural language like "2 PM", "3:30 PM"

### Context Awareness

The unified agent maintains conversation context, so you can use follow-up requests:

```
User: "Schedule a meeting with John tomorrow at 2 PM"
Assistant: "I've scheduled a meeting with John for tomorrow at 2:00 PM."

User: "Send him an email about the meeting"
Assistant: "I'll send an email to John about the meeting we just scheduled."
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Invalid Credentials" Error**
   - Check that your `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_TOKEN` and `GOOGLE_GMAIL_TOKEN` are correct
   - Verify the tokens haven't expired
   - Ensure the tokens have the required scopes

2. **"Permission Denied" Error**
   - Verify your OAuth 2.0 credentials are correct
   - Check that Gmail API and Calendar API are enabled in your Google Cloud project
   - Ensure the user has granted the necessary permissions

3. **"Tool not found" Error**
   - The agent should automatically select the appropriate tools
   - If you get this error, try rephrasing your request more clearly

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging by setting the agent's `verbose=True`:

```python
unified_agent_executor = AgentExecutor(
    agent=agent,
    tools=all_tools,
    memory=memory,
    verbose=True,  # Enable debug output
    handle_parsing_errors=True,
    max_iterations=15
)
```

## üìà Performance Tips

1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear, specific instructions for better results
2. **Use Natural Language**: The agent understands natural language, so be conversational
3. **Provide Context**: Include relevant details like names, times, and locations
4. **Follow-up Requests**: Use the conversation context for related requests

## üîÑ Migration from Separate Agents

If you were previously using separate calendar and Gmail agents, the unified agent provides several advantages:

### Before (Separate Agents)
```python
# Calendar operations
from app.agents.calendar_agent import run_calendar_agent
result = run_calendar_agent("Schedule a meeting with John tomorrow at 2 PM")

# Gmail operations  
from app.agents.gmail_agent import run_gmail_agent
result = run_gmail_agent("Send an email to john@example.com about the meeting")
```

### After (Unified Agent)
```python
# All operations in one agent
from app.agents.unified_agent import run_unified_agent

# Calendar operation
result = run_unified_agent("Schedule a meeting with John tomorrow at 2 PM")

# Gmail operation
result = run_unified_agent("Send an email to john@example.com about the meeting")

# Combined workflow
result = run_unified_agent("Schedule a meeting with John tomorrow at 2 PM and send him an email invitation")
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

1. **Token Security**: Keep your access tokens secure and never commit them to version control
2. **Token Expiration**: Access tokens expire. You'll need to refresh them periodically
3. **Scope Limitation**: Only request the scopes you actually need
4. **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of API rate limits
